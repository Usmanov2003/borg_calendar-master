BORG Calendar
Intro
BORG is a combination calendar and task tracking system. The calendar supports all sorts of appointments and also a simple todo list. The calendar functionality is similar to that of other PIMs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Calendar, Palm Desktop, Yahoo Calendar, etc... The Task Tracker goes way beyond todo's and might better be called a project tracking system. It is a standalone Desktop application.

Why BORG?
A potential BORG user might agree with the following:

I use a calendar/task tracker to remind me to do everything in life that I have to do.
I do not want to access the internet to see my calendar
Some of my data is private. I don't trust putting it on an internet server.
I work on Linux, Windows and other OS's and would like any of my machines to run my calendar program
I like open source software. Even if the developer(s) die, I can still build and enhance my calendar program.
